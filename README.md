# Calculator

This is my first flutter app

It is a simple calculator which performs all simple calculations including sin, cos, tan etc.

Technology used is flutter, coupled with Android Studio.
The modules used are : inbluit packages 'material.dart' and 'math_expression.dart'.

The whole interface is beautifully colored with red, with the shade of 50 and gery, with the shade of 600.
